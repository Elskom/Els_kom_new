    + Split Program to 3 Editions to hep me get EC for the Game. The Editions
        are "Free", "Pro" (30$ EC code), and "Ultimate" (50$ EC Code). Free is
        just like it says, it is free but you can only mod UI koms. Pro you can
        only mod UI koms and Costumes. On Ultimate however you can mod any kom
        you want as long as that kom isn't protected (This would help me
        determine what koms are protected and what aren't). Note: I hate to do
        this but at this moment I am so poor and same in Game, this way I could
        get things I like / want in the game or I could do giveaways or I could
        sell EC from it at probably like 5.5:100~6:100.
